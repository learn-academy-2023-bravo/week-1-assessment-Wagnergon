# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: "===" "<" ">"

Researched answer: Boolean Operators are simple words (AND, OR, NOT or AND NOT) used as conjunctions to combine or exclude keywords in a search, resulting in more focused and productive results.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: Index is the position, value is what number is it or character is it.

Researched answer: 
The index property is a read-only property. It contains the position of a regular expression match within a string. Every value has a type that determines its role. Some values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values are functions, and so on. 


4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are numbers, strings are values.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: One person is the driver who is writing out the code. The other is the navigator who is directing everything. 

Researched answer: In proper pair programming techniques, there are two roles:

The driver: The driver is the person who is actively typing code and implementing the logic. The driver is responsible for writing the code, executing it, and handling the development environment. The driver is also responsible for explaining their thought process to the other person and answering their questions.

The navigator: The navigator is the person who is not actively typing code but is instead focusing on the big picture. The navigator is responsible for thinking ahead, anticipating problems, and helping the driver make strategic decisions. The navigator is also responsible for keeping track of the progress made and noting any potential improvements or adjustments that need to be made.
